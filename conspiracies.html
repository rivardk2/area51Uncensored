				<h2>Area 51 Conspiracies</h2>
				<p>Back in 1955, according to a recently declassified CIA report, a trio of secret operatives scouted the western U.S. for a remote place where the government could test the prototype of the U-2 spy plane. One day, they flew over the Groom Lake salt flat in Nevada, and found exactly were looking for — an old abandoned Army Air Corps airstrip that was just 100 miles (161 km) from Las Vegas, yet so far off the beaten path that it didn't even have a name. On government maps, the place was designated nondescriptly as Area 51 of the Nevada Test Site. For decades, officials tried to avoid even acknowledging the top-secret base's existence, let alone revealing anything about the secret military aerospace research that took place there.</p>

				<ul style="display:none">
					<li>Back in 1989, a man named Bob Lazar claimed that he'd been hired to work briefly as a researcher at a part of Area 51 called S-4, which was so secretive that he and other workers were taken there in a bus with blacked-out windows, so that they couldn't discern the route.</li>
					<li>In the hangars at S-4, Lazar claimed, he saw flying saucers, apparently extraterrestrial in origin. They were powered by antimatter reactors, fueled by a mysterious reddish-orange substance called Element 115. The device generated a &quot;gravity wave&quot; so powerful that if you threw a golf ball in its direction, the ball would bounce off, Lazar recounted. The government was attempting to reverse-engineer the UFOs, in an effort to use the technology for military purposes. Lazar said he was fired from the job after he was caught taking friends out into the desert at night so they could watch test flights of the captured saucers. Lazar's Area 51 credentials later came into question.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote class="clickable-heading">2. Alien Interrogation Center <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></blockquote>
				<ul style="display:none">
					<li>In the imaginations of conspiracy theorists, one of Area 51's functions is to serve as the equivalent of the prison for accused terrorists at Guantanamo Bay. The difference is that the detainees are extraterrestrials, and they don't have to wear orange jumpsuits or listen to loud heavy-metal rock when they're trying to sleep. This thesis is burnished by another of self-described Area 51 scientist Bob Lazar's revelations. He has recalled that while being guided down a hallway at S-4, he momentarily glanced through a small window and caught a glimpse of a small, gray extraterrestrial standing between two men dressed in white coats. Before he could get a better look, he was pushed by a guard who told him to stop looking and keep moving.</li>
					<li>Another self-styled whistleblower, &quot;Victor,&quot; who also claimed to have worked at Area 51, said in a 1997 radio interview that he had witnessed an alien interrogation, and even provided a grainy video which supposedly shows a human officer trying to communicate telepathically with an diminutive extraterrestrial pilot who'd been shot down by the U.S. military.</li>

				<blockquote class="clickable-heading">3. Alien Autopsies <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></blockquote>
				<ul style="display:none">
					<li>This idea has been percolating in popular culture since the mid-1990s, when a 17-minute black-and-white film surfaced which purported to show a team of humans in white bio-hazard protection suits cutting open and removing organs from what appeared to be a tiny alien corpse. The footage aired on TV in multiple countries and copies became a popular mail-order item, even though skeptics noted that the team performing the dissection seemed to be incredibly clumsy with their surgical tools. Years later, the film's producers released a documentary sequel, in which they admitted to faking the autopsy — though they claimed to have done it only to replace genuine footage that had been damaged.</li>

				<ul style="display:none">
					<li>If you're into conspiracy theories with a truly grand sweep, Area 51 is a convenient place to pull all of the threads together. That's why some speculate that the test range is the logical place for the location of Majestic 12. The latter, if you buy the narrative laid out by an anonymous author on the conspiracy site Educate-Yourself.org, is a secret government committee that has been laboring in the shadows for more than six decades to work out an arrangement for a one-world government in which the planet would jointly be ruled by human and extraterrestrial elites.</li>
					<li>MJ-12, as conspiracy junkies refer to it, supposedly started as a blue-ribbon panel of scientists and military leaders created by President Harry Truman in 1947, shortly after the crash of an alien spacecraft near Roswell, New Mexico. As the story goes, MJ-12 somehow eventually made contact with the aliens and brokered a meeting between them and President Dwight Eisenhower. That, in turn, resulted in a deal in which the U.S. government got extraterrestrial technology, in exchange for looking the other way when UFO crews mutilated cattle and abducted humans to conduct weird experiments on them.</li>

				<blockquote class="clickable-heading">5.Staged the Moon Landing <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></blockquote>
				<ul style="display:none">
					<li>In a scenario proposed by conspiracy writer Bill Kaysing, NASA scientists discovered in the late 1960s that it would be impossible to send astronauts to the moon because of lethal radiation risks. But instead of going through an embarrassing shutdown of the costly Apollo program, officials designed an ingenious hoax. They staged an actual rocket launch, but once the spacecraft was out of sight, the Apollo 11 crew secretly was transferred to a military aircraft and flown to a movie stage. A few days later, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin play-acted the lunar landing in front of cameras, and the phony event was then transmitted by NASA to millions of unsuspecting viewers.</li>
					<li>Pretty slick, huh? One problem with that premise: Where could the government stage possibly such a conspiratorial event, without risking the political catastrophe that would come from having the deception exposed? They probably wouldn't have wanted to shoot the fake moon landing in a Hollywood studio. It would have made more sense to film at a remote top-secret military installation, one that general public didn't even know existed. Area 51, of course, would have been perfect for that purpose.</li>

				<p>Nevertheless, it was hard to keep things totally hush-hush after airline pilots started reporting mysterious sightings of UFOs. Area 51 gradually evolved into what a 2009 Los Angeles Times article called &quot;the most famous military institution in the world that doesn't officially exist&quot;. Amateur investigators camped, methodically scanning the sky with binoculars in hopes of catching a glimpse of the secret goings-on. In 2010, after some declassification, former Area 51 employees were able to publicly talk about some of the exotic projects they'd worked on.</p>
				<p>But the actual, documented secrets of Area 51 turn out to be pretty ho-hum compared to the pop-culture mythology that has developed around the place. Area 51's classified nature made it the perfect blank slate for generations of conspiracy theorists. Here are 5 of their more outlandish assertions.</p>
